## Project Details:

>  +  Simualator contains 2D map of environment..
>  +  Environment contains: Bot, Obstacles, GPS_Waypoints
>  +  Bot needs to be able to move through the simulator; Pathfind from Start to Target
>  +  Bot contains:  It's own information about the environment..
   
   
## Problems:

>  +  How can we describe objects in the map?
>  +  How do we find the list of nearby objects we are interested in?
>  +  What methodology is needed to find a path?
>  +  How can we be sure that our path is **drivable**?
>  +  How do we define **drivable**? (ie: max turn radius at given speeds, not enough space, ..)

## 
--
>  +  Bot has Search Radius. When an obstacle enters the Bot radius.. the Bot must store the position of said obstacle
>  +  in it's internal map. (The Obstacle has it's own properties/functions that describe it's surface)
>  +  When we need to generate the Bot's Path, the Bot needs to consider Obstacles in it's map
>  +  When we need to identify obstacles.. we need to make a prediction given the information about the obstacle..
#####   Predictions are based on: 
>> +  Surface Structure (the part that is visible to us from our perspective)
>> +  Color..


  
## Solutions:

>   1.  Map<> 
>   2.  Using IGV(x,y) .. index into map.. 
>   3.  A* 
>   4.  JSmoke libraries :)
>   5.  ...

## Ideas:

#### Path:
Map starts out fully drivable with no obstacles..

Open space. Drivable along path: Start -> GPS Points -> Target 

  + When IGV detects obstacle.. create two nodes, to the left and right of the obstacle (store in graph with distances h)
  
Detect obstacle with Camera Code..

However, in the simulator we detect an obstacle by finding it in a map structure of some sort...
